Designing Website Interfaces
THIS IS THE W3 ASSIGNMENT CROSSWORD PUZZLE ASSIGNMENT. AND THIS IS THE MAIN3 BRANCH.
THIS IS WHERE THE FOLDERS WILL GO.
EVERY FILE IS NUMBERED AND LABELED AND IS IN ORDER. 
I SEPERATE EVERYTHING UNDER BRANCHES, SO EVERY FILE I UPLOAD DOESN'T GET MIXED UP AND CONFUSED ALL THE OTHER FILES I POST A FEW WEEKS BACK.
THE PHOTO'S ARE WITHIN THIS FILE NUMBER WITH 1, 2, AND 3 SO NOTHING GETS MIXED UP.
