# CSC256---Designing-Website-Interfaces-I--
PLEASE READ THE READ ME FILE.
THESE FILES HAVE THE THE CODE THAT I DID IN THE W1 FIRST ASSIGNMENT, BUT I MADE CHANGES TO IT, SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT I DID.
I WASN'T SURE IF THE CONTEXT OF THE GUIDELINES WERE ASKING FOR MAKING ANOTHER HTML FILE, SO I DIDN'T DO THAT, AND JUST CREATED THE JAVASCRIPT FILE.

I ADDED THE PICTURES, SO YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I ADDED TO MY CODE, AND ALL.

THANK YOU!
